# 🤖 JetBot Collision Avoidance using Deep Learning (AlexNet)

This project implements **real-time obstacle avoidance** on the [JetBot](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetbot) platform using a **camera feed and deep learning classification model**. The robot detects whether the path is **blocked or free**, and navigates accordingly. Click [here](https://youtu.be/xOFaC9Rw5iY) to check the final outcome

##  Project Goal

To make a small NVIDIA JetBot **autonomously avoid obstacles** by analyzing the camera feed in real time using a lightweight convolutional neural network (AlexNet or ResNet18).

---

##  Features Involved

- 🔍 **Real-time camera processing** via GStreamer + OpenCV
- 🧠 **Deep learning inference** using PyTorch + GPU (fp16)
- 🧭 **Autonomous navigation** with simple logic
- ⚙️ Runs directly on Jetson Nano without cloud dependency
- 🛠️ Handles **camera initialization**, model loading, and motor control

##  Model Details

The model is trained to classify camera images into two categories:
- **Blocked** – if there’s an obstacle ahead
- **Free** – if the path is clear

Models used:
- `AlexNet` (Modified final FC layer to output 2 classes)
